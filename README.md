Android versions** with improved performance and compatibility.

## **How to Create a Custom Skin** 🎨

ANeko supports **both app-based skins and manual file-based skins**.

- **For app-based skins** →  
  See [Skin Documentation](http://www.tamanegi.org/prog/android-apps/aneko-skin.html#create-skin).  
  If you are developing a custom skin within the project, you can create a new module, such as
  `skin:sample`, to define your skin assets and logic. Ensure that your module follows the ANeko
  skin structure.

- **For file-based skins** →  
  You can manually place skin files in the correct directory (More details in upcoming
  documentation).
